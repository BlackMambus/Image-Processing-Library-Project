 üñºÔ∏è Image Processing Library Description

An image processing library is a collection of tools and functions that enable developers to manipulate, analyze, and transform digital images using software. These libraries are essential in fields like computer vision, machine learning, photography, and design, making it easier to automate and enhance visual content.

üß∞ Core Capabilities
Image Loading & Saving: Support for multiple formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG, BMP).

Filtering & Enhancement: Apply blur, sharpen, contrast adjustment, and noise reduction.

Transformation: Resize, rotate, crop, and flip images programmatically.

Color Manipulation: Convert between color spaces (RGB, grayscale, HSV), adjust brightness or saturation.

Edge Detection & Feature Extraction: Tools for detecting objects, contours, or patterns.

Image Segmentation: Divide images into meaningful regions for further analysis.

Metadata Handling: Access and modify image metadata like EXIF data.

Integration with Machine Learning: Preprocess images for training models (e.g., normalization, augmentation).
